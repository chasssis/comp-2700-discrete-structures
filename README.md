# comp-2700-discrete-structres

this is a compilation of all my labs from discrete structures for documentation purposes. wish i would have done this for intro to python as well but oh well lol. those were all fairly elementary displays of basic functions of python. 

lab 1 is a look into list and subsets. it also uses recursive calling for optimization

lab 2 checks whether a relation is a valid function between sets, determines its range, tests whether it is one-to-one or onto, computes its inverse if it is bijective, and then runs a series of test cases to verify each behavior.

Lab 3 is an implementation of RSA encryption.
